## Behavior Search

1. Design a quantitative measure for the behavior you're interested in.
2. Choose parameters to vary and what ranges are allowed.
3. Choose a search algorithm and run it.
4. Examine the results (what parameters most affect this behavior?)

## HubNet

HubNet adds a new dimension to NetLogo by letting simulations run not just according to rules, but by direct human participation.
